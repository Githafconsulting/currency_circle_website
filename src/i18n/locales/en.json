      "q1": {
        "question": "How does Currency Circle work?",
        "answer": "Currency Circle connects you directly with other verified users who want to exchange currencies. You create an offer of the amount and currency you have and the amount and currency you need. We match you with compatible users, you choose who you want to exchange with and pay a small fee of 0.5% to unlock your match. You both agree how to exchange the currencies and leave reviews for each other."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is Currency Circle safe and secure?",
        "answer": "Yes. We do not hold any funds and transactions are not executed on the application. Once users are matched, they agree how to exchange outside of the app. We verify all users and set risk-ratings to help users decide who to exchange with. Our peer review system also ensures you can see ratings from previous exhanges before agreeing to exchange currenicie."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What fees does Currency Circle charge?",
        "answer": "We charge a small matching fee only when you successfully complete a trade. There are no hidden fees, no subscription costs, and no charges for browsing or posting offers. You set your own exchange rate, so you control the value you get."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does verification take?",
        "answer": "Most verifications are completed within 24 hours. You'll need to upload a government-issued ID and proof of address. Our team reviews each submission manually to ensure the highest security standards for all users."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What currencies can I exchange?",
        "answer": "Currency Circle supports over 150 currencies from around the world. You can exchange any major currency including USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, and many more. Check the app for the complete list of supported currencies."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "How long does an exchange take to complete?",
        "answer": "The average exchange is completed within 24 hours of accepting a match. The actual time depends on your coordination with your trading partner and your chosen payment method. Some users complete exchanges within a few hours."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "What if I have a problem with my trading partner?",
        "answer": "Our support team is available 24/7 to help resolve any issues. We also have a dispute resolution system that protects both parties. You can report any problems directly through the app, and our team will investigate and help find a fair solution."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "Can I cancel a trade after accepting?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can cancel a trade before the exchange is completed. However, we encourage users to only accept offers they intend to complete. Frequent cancellations may affect your user rating and matching priority."
